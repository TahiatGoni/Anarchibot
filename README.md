# Anarchibot
For Cmput350 Starcraft II Bot

Please look at only "Main_submission" folder.
Extract the Main_submission.rar file.

Uploading the VS folder so that TAs can just download and run.
My Bot is named anarchibot but I used the BasicSc2Bot as a template.
Did not change the project file names so name shows as BasicSc2Bot.
Go into AnarchiBot>Build and then open BasicSc2Bot.sln.
